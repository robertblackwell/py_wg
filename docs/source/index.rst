Welcome to Python Workgang (pywg)
=================================

Python Workgroup is a command line utility `pywg` that executes a command or utility based on an input stream of arguments
and can run those commands on concurrent processes.

Think of the `-P` option for the Linux command `xargs` or GNU `parallel`.
